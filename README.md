# Minimal Clipboard Manager

## TODOs

Primary Selection: This is often referred to as the "middle-mouse-button" selection.
It's designed for quick, temporary data transfers, primarily within the same application or between applications that are closely related in workflow.
The user typically selects text or other content and then "pastes" it by clicking the middle mouse button in the target application.
It's a transient selection; the data might not be immediately available after the initial paste.
Think of it as a quick copy-paste mechanism.
The primary selection is often cleared when the user makes a new selection or performs other actions.

Clipboard Selection (often just called "the clipboard"): This is the more persistent selection, usually associated with Ctrl+C (copy) and Ctrl+V (paste) shortcuts.
It's intended for more deliberate data transfers, often between completely different applications.
The clipboard's contents are typically preserved until explicitly replaced by a new copy operation.
This makes it suitable for transferring larger amounts of data or data that needs to be available for a longer period.
